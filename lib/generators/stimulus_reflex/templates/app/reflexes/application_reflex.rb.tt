  #
  # If your ActionCable connection is: `identified_by :current_user`
  #   delegate :current_user, to: :connection
  #
  # current_user delegation alloqs you to use the Current pattern, too:
  #   before_reflex do
  #     Current.user = current_user
  #   end
  #
  # To access view helpers inside Reflexes:
  #   delegate :helpers, to: :ApplicationController
  #
  # If you need to localize your Reflexes, you can set the I18n locale here:
  #
  #   before_reflex do
  #     I18n.locale = :fr
  #   end
  #
  # For code examples, considerations and caveats, see:
